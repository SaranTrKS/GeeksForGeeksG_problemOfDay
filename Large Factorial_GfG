Medium Accuracy: 75.76% Submissions: 5943 Points: 4
You are given an array A of integers of length N. You need to calculate factorial of each number. The answer can be very large, so print it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output:
1 1 2 6 24
Explanation:
Factorial of 0 is 1, 
factorial of 1 is 1, factorial of 2 is 2, 
factorial of 3 is 6 and so on.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
A[] = {5, 6, 3}
Output:
120 720 6
Explanation:
Factorial of 5 is 120, 
factorial of 6 is 720, 
factorial of 3 is 6.

Your Task:
Complete the function factorial() which takes list a and single integer n, as input parameters and returns a list of factorials of the numbers in the list a.


Expected Time Complexity: O(max(A) + N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(max(A))


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= A[i] <= 105

class Solution:

	def factorial(self,a, n):
    	# code here
    	dic = {}
    	fac = 1
    	res = []
    	dic[0] = 1
    	m = 1000000007
    	for i in range(1, max(a) + 1):
    	    fac = fac % m
    	    i = i % m
    	    fac = (fac * i) % m 
    	    dic[i] = fac 
    	    
    	for j in a:
    	    res.append(dic[j])
    	    
    	return res
